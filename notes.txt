The Data Science Workflow
1. Get Data
  2. Clean it
  3. Explore it
  4. Model it (machine learning) *relatively easy
  5. Interpret

What is Machine Learning?
	- Statistical Modeling
	- Computer Intelligence
	- Adaptive

software developer
	* follow steps to make computer do what you want
data scientist
	* write a black box that allows a computer to make decisions on its own

Types of machine learning problems
 supervised => making predictions
 unsupervised => discovering patterns
 	* running a clustering algorithm

 Linear Regression:
 	taking a set of features from an observation - creating numerical output
 	using one value to predict another
